        <h2>More about "Fashion is more than clothing "</h2>
        <p class="p2">I had just finished interviewing my friend for a series on talented black women (coming soon) for National Womens month and we got to talking about fashion. I asked her a question, “Why do designers make abstract clothes that nobody is going to wear on the street? Whats the point?”
          I figured since she is a fashion design student and has done a fashion show herself that she would know the answer to my question.
          What she said changed my perspective on fashion.<br> “Fashion is art”
          I had never heard fashion explained in this way. I didnt even know fashion could be considered art.
          But what is art anyway? Is it a drawing, painting, sculpture, architecture? Art is all these things and a little more.</p>
