      <p class="p1">Art doesnt just appear in a museum or on a slab of a canvas. Art is everywhere. Its in the music we sing, the words we write, and the clothes we make.</p>
      <p class="p1">Its an expression of our creative imagination whether it be simple or abstract. Art isnt defined by a group of thought leaders or Merriam Websters Dictionary. Art is whatever you deem it to be.</p>
      <p class="p1">Fashion is art. Its a form of creative expression carried out by a designer and put on our blank canvassed bodies.</p>
      <p class="p1">When we start to look at fashion, and any other creative skill, our perception of it will change and we will have a better appreciation for it.</p>

      <p class="p1">Three Floor, a London based brand I first blogged about last year, has been going from strength to strength over the last few seasons. It has been featured in numerous magazines and worn by as many celebrities, most recently by Saturday’s beauty Milly King. In truth I have been meaning to feature their AW12 dresses on My Fashion Wish List for a while, since I have been drooling over them for weeks, failing to decide exactly which one is my favourite. So here they are – the five hottest dresses in town by a label everyone is talking about. If you are not a fan yet, you have fallen off the fashion wagon.</p>

        By Stylish Petite:
        Today was a great day and Christmas came early for me.  Woo hoo!  After almost three months since my car accident, I finally picked up my new Tesla!  I’ve been driving a rental car this entire time so needless to say I was very excited when I heard the car was ready earlier than expected.  We had the model S before and I loved it however it wasn’t exactly kid friendly so I decided to get the model X.  The doors alone are worth it because it makes it so much easier with Milan.  Anyway, wanted to share this simple casual outfit plus this plaid scarf is only $25 + free shipping!      </div><br>
